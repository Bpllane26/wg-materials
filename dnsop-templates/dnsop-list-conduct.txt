Colleagues,

As some of you have noted,  the thread under the subject XXX has
included some inappropriate posts, not consistent with the IETF
Code of Conduct or guidance on keeping the WG mailing list professional
and productive. A DNSOP mailing list participant has been warned
about their posts and asked to stop.

As a reminder to the list: people here can be vigorous and intense
in their arguments and tone, but generally stay to the civil and
constructive side, and the chairs don’t like stepping into substantive
technical discussions. However, we do monitor the list, do listen
to complaints, and do have the ability to take action when list
conversation turns into persistently repeating arguments that have
already been addressed, ad hominem attacks, or other behavior that
has no apparent purpose besides disruption.


It’s important to bring your best technical arguments to DNSOP, but
just as important in getting our work done to bring civility and
respect for everyone else. These things matter even more over the
last couple of years of seeing each other only online.


In general, DNSOP has done pretty well at keeping things professional
and productive. It’s part of the chairs’ job to keep it that way.
Thanks everyone,
