Larger Discussion on Differences in Response Drafts


In Berlin we had two presentations on different methods of returning multiple responses:

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-wkumari-dnsop-multiple-responses/

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-bellis-dnsext-multi-qtypes/

and a presentation in Buenos Aires:

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-vavrusa-dnsop-aaaa-for-free/

All of these documents are attempting to solve a larger problem in different ways.
The end result is "Return Associated Answer" to the client.

The question is starting to coalesce around these two premises:

- Do we want to Server to PUSH any or all Associated Answers, or

- Do we want the Client to PULL any or all Associated Answers
