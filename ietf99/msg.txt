From Last Meeting:

From the DNSOP notes from last Tuesday:

- multi-qtypes discussion (maybe push down)
- Actions from IETF99 - see below
- Wildcard discussion - lost context
- RPZ: direction

## Actions from DNSOP IETF99

draft-ietf-dnsop-terminology-bis
    May need some focused effort to work through items

draft-ietf-dnsop-dns-capture-format
    - new version addressing the issues raised during Hackathon

draft-ietf-dnsop-rfc5011-security-considerations
    - Wes still needs to make changes before He and Mike can hug it out

draft-ietf-dnsop-aname:
    - Document needs an update/simplification.  May need to adress the DNSSEC issue
      in a stand alone meeting

draft-ietf-dnsop-session-signal
    - The more we peel this onion, the more concerned the chairs are.

draft-tale-dnsop-serve-stale
    - call for adoption issued. 

draft-muks-dnsop-dns-opportunistic-refresh: Stephen Morris
    - received by some, but a bit more complex then server-stale.
