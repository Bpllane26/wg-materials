George Michaelson(GM): Will not get full consensus on all terms

unknown: start writing the older ones

Paul Hoffman: Off topic for this

Andrew Sullivan: look at other definitions, and see if they make sense

Dan York for Viktor define 'interderminate' in DNSSEC

PH: take to the list, but yes

PH: WGLC by Prague hopefully

* Vcelak, [draft-vcelak-nsec5](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-vcelak-nsec5)
    NSEC5, DNSSEC Authenticated Denial of Existence

Ondrej: Simlified Draft

unknown: nit on private vs crypto key

Evsn Hunt: elegant solution to a problem I don;t think we have
  Never heard anyone adopting dnssec w.out nsec5

Daniel Kahn Gilmour:  says he knows of people who want to deploy but are waiting for NSEC5

Dan York/Sam Weiler; get them to explain their requirements to us
Dan/Viktor - planning support for x2559
Shumon Huque:
Sam Weiler: details or it didn't work
Peter Koch: how will it interact with aggressive negative caching

AJS: can we implement practically  ; cost to deply; cost to standards process
depolyment effects i plan

several other algorithm transistions coming up :

paul vixie: zone enumeration demo using acid dns

roy arends: proof key posted but the signing key is not public

jim reid: IPR issues -

Sara: still open IPR issues

* Dickinson, [draft-ietf-dnsop-dns-capture-format](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-dnsop-dns-capture-format)

DC: only two

John Levine; situation less dire. SRV is fine.

Brian Dickson: weird table Q

Stuart Cheshire: 2782 things is fixed

Working with Century link folks. trying to clean up

Ondrej: generally like the idea, have something similar in knot.
overengineered.

understand

Brian Dickson: perl regexp

Jimmeni: fairly complicated

Willhem: same position as Ondrej

John Levine; fundamental change to how name servers operate

(https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-arends-dnsop-dnssec-algorithm-update)
