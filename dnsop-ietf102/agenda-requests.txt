# Current Adopted work 

* [draft-ietf-dnsop-terminology-bis](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-terminology-bis/)
    The terminology team would *maybe* like agenda time to discuss what we hope 
    will be the closing of the WG Last Call. We ask that the chairs watch the WG 
    Last Call discussion to see if there is anything controversial. If not, saying in 
    the chairs report that you are moving this the IETF Last Call is fine, but if there 
    is something from the WG Last Call you want discussed, let us know and we can d
    o a short presentation.

* [draft-kh-dnsop-7706bis](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-kh-dnsop-7706bis/)
    Warren and I have recently updated draft-kh-dnsop-7706bis to make the
    document match current practice. In the past year, there is more
    interest from resolver developers in supporting the ideas behind 7706 in
    shipping products, and there is a bit of groundswell in some ICANN
    communities to have a more formal way to distribute the root zone for
    resolvers to use. We would like at least 10 minutes to present the new
    and expected diffs from 7706 and see if the WG wants to take this topic
    up again.
