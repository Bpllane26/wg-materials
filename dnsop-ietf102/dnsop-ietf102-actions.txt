All 

Thanks for a pretty productive week and thanks for 
breaking in our new chair slowly.  

Rough Minutes have been uploaded:

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/minutes-102-dnsop/

And I apologize - I took notes of the last topic on Thursday but have
somehow lost them. I will listen to the audio and update those comments 
early next week. 

If you have issues with the minutes drop the chairs a note, *or*
send us a pull request:

IETF103:  I am thinking we will focus on one meeting next time, 
though who knows, we may 

Actions: 

Here is what we have in terms of actions from this week.  
If we missed something, it's my fault.  

* draft-ietf-dnsop-kskroll-sentinel - Submitted to IESG 

* draft-ietf-dnsop-isp-ip6rdns - Submitted to IESG

* draft-ietf-dnsop-attrleaf  
* draft-ietf-dnsop-attrleaf-fix
    - WGLC has ended, Shepherd write up is underway (with thanks
    to Mr. Crocker!), and working with Benno on this.  He's 
    double checking everything to make sure pushing the button
    won't end the world. 

    - The chairs feel these documents need to move thru the process 
    promptly so other working groups can seek their guidance. 

* draft-ietf-dnsop-rfc5011-security-considerations 
    - We are holding this for now, and the chairs feel that 
    there is an issue with consensus and content that will 
    most likely kill this moving forward. 

* draft-ietf-dnsop-terminology-bis
    - Write-up is wrapping up and *will be submitted* by Monday at 
    the latest. 

* draft-ietf-dnsop-dns-capture-format 
    - WGLC last call ended with two issues to be addressed.
    These will be resolved in Early August after Holiday. 

* draft-huque-dnsop-multi-provider-dnssec:  Adopted ! 

* draft-ietf-dnsop-algorithm-update - is almost ready for WGLC

* draft-dupont-dnsop-rfc2845bis - is almost ready for WGLC

* draft-wessels-dns-zone-digest - Candidate for adoption

* draft-kh-dnsop-7706bis - Candidate for adoption.

* draft-bortzmeyer-rfc7816bis - Candidate for adoption

* draft-song-atr-large-resp - Candidate for adoption, though more contentious. 

* DNS Cookies and their Operational Impacts 
    - We expect to see drafts addressing these issues, as well as 
    drafts urging to move cookies to Historic to appear. 

* Addressing the Zone Apex Synthetic Records (CNAME/ALIAS/ANAME/ZNAME) 
    - We will continue to work to address this gap between the user community 
    and the protocol folks.
