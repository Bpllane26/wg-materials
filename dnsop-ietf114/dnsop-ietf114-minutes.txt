    Please volunteer to review documents for the new directorate

IETF 114 Hackathon Results
    Nils Wisiol talked about work on DNSSEC bootstrapping
    Yorgos Thessalonikefs talked about DNS error reporting

DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC): Paul Hoffman
    draft-ietf-dnsop-dnssec-bcp
    No questions at the mic

Recommendations for DNSSEC Resolvers Operators: Daniel Migault
    draft-ietf-dnsop-dnssec-validator-requirements
    No questions at the mic 

Survey of Domain Verification Techniques using DNS: Shivan Kaul Sahib
    draft-sahib-domain-verification-techniques
    John O'Brien: Glad to see commentary on time-limited
        Some service providers require that a domain being validated by a second-level domain
        Some require that it be at a zone cut
    John Levine: It should be a BCP
        Shivan: Could be an RRtype, but dropped
            Was meant as a survey, but could be a BCP
    Brett Carr: Make it a BCP
        Too many ways to do it
    Anthony Somerset: Make it a BCP
        Draw more attention to the TCP fallback problem
    Ben Schwartz: Add a sentence about DNAME
        Doesn't care what it says, but it should say something
    Chairs: Asked if there were objections to BCP; none in the room

dry-run DNSSEC: Yorgos Thessalonikefs
    draft-yorgos-dnsop-dry-run-dnssec
    Wes Hardaker: Likes this
        Must not get in the way of current validation
        Thus: no DS hacks
    Steve Crocker: Doesn't like going insecure
        Yorgos: Only arises when you are testing, not when actually signed
    Viktor Dukhovni: Concern that all resolvers will act correctly when presented with an unknown DS
        Tested with DS 0, found failure
        Would need many resolvers to adopt this before it would be useful
    Paul Hoffman: Would like the variable-size DS for pre-testing post-quantum signing algorithms
    Ben: Would like to know the error rate, not just the reporters
        Yorgos: Can turn on "no error" report
    Lars-Johan Liman: Likes this
        In order to avoid having lingering things, would like to have timers to turn this off
        Suggests that software pull them after a time
    Wes: This supports doing algorithm roll
        Lots of corner cases, including larger responses
    Peter Thomassen: Keeping around longer is only harder on the registry
        Should be their policy
        Maybe not needed for PQC because the hash size won't change much
        Resolver will choose the first DS type it knows, so naive resolver might not see this
            Yorgos: Have an idea on how to implement for this
    Sam Weiler: RFC 4955 says to use a reserved DNSKEY to do this
    Nils: Would prefer EDNS0 in clients where clients have opted in
    Viktor: Doesn't think client-side will work because of caching
        Likes stealing a bit from the hash algorithm
    Mark Andrews: Variable length digests for private OID types; don't be scared of them
        Maybe want a dry-run as DNSKEY as well
        Thinks this is safe to experiment

Initializing a DNS Resolver with Priming Queries: Paul Hoffman
    draft-klh-dnsop-rfc8109bis
    No questions at the mic 

Structured Data for Filtered DNS: Dan Wing
    draft-wing-dnsop-structured-dns-error-page
    John O'Brien: Should look at how this interacts with RPZs
    Petr Spaƒçek: Have you heard from browser vendors?
        More positive response
    Brett: Supports adoption
    Ben: This revision is an improvement
        Should this be in DNSOP? This is a deeper question
        Browsers already have their own private mechanisms 
    Tim: Chairs want to hear from folks who want to implement this
    Johnathan Reed: Supports adoption
        Akamai could implement this for some of its services
    Viktor: This is for reporting RPZ names
        Not in conflict with what browsers are doing
    Chris Box: Would like to see this developed
    John O'Brien: Useful for applications other than web browsers

Recent results on measuring the end-to-end success rate of DNSSEC and new record types: Eric Rescorla
    Ray Bellis: Home gateway resolvers are much worse at passing DNSSEC records
    Brian Dickson: Could you test this for particular routers
        Eric: Probably yes
    Hazel Smith: Had done some testing on DoT and DoH resolvers; do you have any called-out data?
        Eric: No, started at the end of their study
            Assume that they work
    Viktor: Can this be done by geography?
        Eric: Data will be in the paper
    Mark: Could you do the EDNS0 query?
        Eric: Can show the code
    Daniel Kahn Gillmore: Wants to see by size of packets
        Eric: In the report
        Daniel: We need to think what we can do when we know there are parts of the network is garbage
    Wes: RFC 8027 covered some of this
        Table is missing RRSIG
        Eric: Took out of the report
        
CDS/CDNSKEY Consistency Is Mandatory: Peter Thomassen
    draft-thomassen-dnsop-cds-consistency
    Mark: CDS records are no different than any others
        One NS might be down, which would stop the 
        Peter: This is telling the parent how to act when faced with inconsistent information
    Viktor: There might be hidden masters
        Don't want to get stuck
        Peter: Wording could be changed to allow servers down
    Ben: There is a missing time constant
        When do I recheck if I get an inconsistent set?
        Peter: 7344 doesn't put any time limit
        Ben: Should suggest some time to retry when there is an inconstancy
