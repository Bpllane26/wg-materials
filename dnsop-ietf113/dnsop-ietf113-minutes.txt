    Warren Kumari: Would really like something in addition
        Discussed with the IESG to start up a short WG for DNSSEC-as-BCP, weren't interested
        Asks WG for a favor to move this to the front of the queue
    Adjustments for Multi-signer: Ulrich Wisser
        Request to consider changes to RFC 4034 about requiring signatures for all algorithms
        Wants more discussion on list

Negative Caching of DNS Resolution Failures
draft-dwmtwc-dnsop-caching-resolution-failures, Duane Wessels
    Also presented at the DNS-OARC meeting in 2022-02
    Paul Wouters: Why is exponential backoff a must?
        Duane: Most important is "at least 5 seconds"
         Would be willing to make this mandatory
    Ralf Weber: Supports adoption
    Lars-Johan Liman: Supports adoption
    Hazel Smith: Good idea
        What proportion is coming from large public resolvers?
        Are these restrictions supposed to be across all anycast addresses?
            Duane: This is per backend server
                Maybe can be more specific in language
                Sees thousands of queries per second from each backend server
    Jim Reid: Strong support
        Wants the numbers of seconds to wait to be more evidence-based
        Was the bulk from a small number of resolvers?
            Duane: Verisign identified some of the sources, including the large recursive resolvers (by address)
    WG chairs will send out call for adoption soon

DNS Referral Glue Requirements
draft-ietf-dnsop-glue-is-not-optional, Duane Wessels
    Ben Schwartz: Terminology is confusing, with conflicting defintions in different RFCs
        Doesn't think "referral glue" distinction is helpful
        Should be from parents uniformly
        Duane: But we have sibling glue different than in-domain glue
        Important distinction is location
    Paul Hoffman: Put definition in the terminology document
    Brett Carr: Put it in the terminology doucment
        Good for training new staff
        Keep the terminology document active
    Ralf: All glue is for referral
        Not sure if taking out the registry requirement is good
        If a registry doesn't need to implement this, we are not gaining anything
        Duane: Take this to the list
            Different registries have different modes of operation, didn't want to change their models
            "Host object" use
    Hazel: Could not find a straight answer whether DS records are glue or not
    Alexander Mayrhofer: Important to differentiate "registry accepts data", "registry puts data in zone", "auth server sends data"
        This document focuses on third step
        Maybe second step could be in REGEXT WG
    Some things will go back to the list

Using Service Bindings with DANE,
draft-rebs-dnsop-svcb-dane, Ben Schwartz
    Wes Hardaker: The reason DANE changes the target is about control of the certificate
        Doesn't want to chase CDN certs, do the least amount of management
        Ben: Thinks this pushes the furthest in that direction

dry-run DNSSEC
draft-yorgos-dnsop-dry-run-dnssec, Willem Toorop
    Gavin Brown: Useful tool
        Validate DS algorithms from EPP, check the hash lengths
        Can't add dry run, would need an EPP extension
    Shane Kerr: Can this help with a root algorithm rollover?
        Willem: Useful for any dommain
    Ralf: Adding complexity to validation code
        Get clients to implement EDE
        Should not make resolver more and more complex
        Willem: Goal is to give operators more confidence
    Ben: This is a recurring paterm (stuff things into DS types)
        Should maybe have a general-purpose meta DS type
        Would we be better off providing some best practice on how to set up a duplicate parallel zone  

Stateful Hash-Based Signatures for DNSSEC
draft-afrvrd-dnsop-stateful-hbs-for-dnssec, Roland van Rijswijk-Deij
    Stephen Farrell: "Safe" is not the whole thing
        Roland: Must stop with the finite number of signatures
    Gavin: How much state needs to be stored, and for how long?
        Roland: Which key has been used (sequence number) for the lifetime of the key
        Have a finite time for your key, need to roll before you finish
        Roland: Depends on parameter choices
        Should implement but not use?
        Rolamd: Maybe for the root and TLDs?
            Would be not be MUST implement, MUST be able to valdidated
    Paul: Would not want adoption until the implementation aspects doc is published
    Stephen: Bad idea all arond
        Never think about stateful signatures for DNSSEC
    Peter Thomassen: Confused about how it could be not preferred but implemented
        Roland: Should be implemented but not deployed

Expressing Quality of Service Requirements (QoS) in Domain Name System (DNS) Queries
draft-eastlake-dnsop-expressing-qos-requirements, Donald Eastlake III
    Ben: This sounds like a job for service bindings
        Doesn't like the idea of putting this in a label very appealing
        Use SVBC instead
        Donald: Requires application know about SVCB, but this could be used without
    Ulrich: QoS is a property of the network path
        How would resolver know about the path?

Structured Data for Filtered DNS
draft-wing-dnsop-structured-dns-error-page, Tirumal Reddy
    Ralf: Shows good usage of extended errors, has an experimental implementation
    Tommy Pauly: Supportive of this area, wants adoption
    Ben: Meant for the client that opens a web page that is selected by the resolver
        Very different security model than what we have now
        Wants it to be truly machine-readable, not presented to the user
        Tiru: Text fields are optional
