Administrivia
        Normal review of old work, preview of new work
        Is thinking of opening tup discussion of terminology

Fragmentation Avoidance in DNS, draft-ietf-dnsop-avoid-fragmentation
        Kazunori Fujiwara
        No comments came from the floor

Service binding and parameter specification via the DNS, draft-ietf-dnsop-svcb-https
        Ben Schwartz
        Ready for WG Last Call
        Benno: Are you coordinating interop testing, or should the chairs?
        Ben: Authors have not done any yet, want advice on how that should work
                Range of implementors that are known
        Benno: Will mobilize developers for WG Last Call
        Suzanne: Need adequate cross-area review
        Ben: Implications go up to the application area
        Tommy Pauly: Apple has an implementation of this
                Actively in beta, but not all features currently
                Some networks don't play well with new RRtypes
        Allison Mankin: Impressed with progress
                Hoping that the interop testing focuses on large DNS providers
                Salesforce will try to encourage among their vendors
        Benno: Interop before WG Last Call
        Suzanne: Want more WG review now, don't wait for WG Last Call

The DELEGATION_ONLY DNSKEY flag, draft-ietf-dnsop-delegation-only
        Paul Wouters
        No comments from the floor
        Benno: Would like to see more feedback from the WG
        PaulW: Got private feedback that there is interest

Parameterized Nameserver Delegation with NS2 and NS2T, draft-tapril-ns2
        Tim April
        PaulH: Need to coordinate across WGs
        Peter van Dijk: Has different draft in DPRIVE
        Ben: Also overlaps with "adaptive DNS" proposal in ADD
                Would like to see them all, maybe combined
        Sam Weiler: Have you thought of the processing rules if it is only in the parent?
                Tim: Authoritative in the child
        Jim Reid: Would be better to settle on one WG to deal with this
        Suzanne: There should be one place
        Puneet Sood: In Section 3.1, the EDNSO size is in conflict with current proposals
                Should try to keep to a minimum how much information goes into the records
        Ben: Doesn't need to take this down to one draft
        PaulH: Please look at these as use cases, not drafts
        Benno: Will coordinate with other WGs

Initializing a DNS Resolver with Priming Queries, draft-klh-dnsop-rfc8109bis
        Paul Hoffman
        No questions from the floor
        The chairs tested the hum tool
        Hum for adoption: strong
        Hum against adoption: weak
        Wes Hardaker: It is not clear if people who don't hum count as humming weakly

Revised IANA Considerations for DNSSEC, draft-hoffman-dnssec-iana-cons
        Paul Hoffman
        Sam: S/MIME and TLS are end-to-end, DNSSEC is in the middle
                IPsec is similar
        Viktor Dukhovni: Agree with Sam about importance of the middle
        Ben: Not a strong feeling
                TLS ciphersuites are larger spaces
                TLS client certificate types, also single octet, might also be relevant
                PGP has IETF review
                Fairly diverse range of practices
        Jim Reid: should adopt, make similar to other WGs
                Needs to be more flexible
                Should add mandatory or optional to implement
        Ondřej Surý: Camel issues
                Interop is more important in DNSSEC than in TLS world
                Clients and servers are upgraded more slowly
                Should be careful about relaxing the requirement
                Maybe want guidance from CFRG before we accept new algorithms
        Warren Kumari: standards track feels like endorsing
                Likes RFC required
                Still needs to go through a process
                Some TLS registries has notes in them
                Interop is important, which argues for why we should make the registry easier to get into
        Mike St Johns: point-to-multipoint system
                Could have different policies for TSIG
                How do we get/maintain interop?
                National crypto should be second signature on standard crypto
        Valery Smyslov: In favor of adoption to make more consistent
                Will not place high bar so national crypto can get code points without too much dificulty
        Daniel Kahn Gilmore: Using PGP and TLS as examples is bad because they have negotiation
                Want a minimum number of ciphersuites for DNS
        Benno: good discussion here and on mailing list


DNS Access Denied Error page, draft-reddy-dnsop-error-page
        Tirumaleswar Reddy
        Ben: This is not a good use of the HTTPS record type
                HTTPS is a way to reach the page
                Not compatible with DNSSEC if there is a validating stub answer
                Restrictions might not be implementable in web browsers
                Even then, not actually safe due to phishing
                Tiru: that's why it has to be a trusted DoH or DoT server
        Jim: Breaks the DNS protocol because the answer is not what the client asked
                Tiru: comes in the Additional section
                        And only comes with extended error codes
        Jonathan Reed: Appreciates a draft that helps end users despite implementation concerns
        Wes Hardaker: This is not safe even if it is a trusted DoH or DoT
                Allows malicious ISPs who have MITMs
                Tiru: must be a trusted DoH or DoT
        Erid Orth: General support for solving this problem
                We can't trust this protocol as-is
                Bad idea to do anything for forging results
                Maybe put in EDNS0
        Warren: No hats, hate the idea of DNS filtering, so we need a way to make it as non-harmful as possible
                Needs signals from the browser to the users if something like this is done
                Needs input from browser vendors first
        Eric Rescorla: Doesn't think Firefox would be interested to this
                Wants to keep the interface to themselves, not to farm it out to resolvers
                Trusted resolvers are trusting with user data, not with the data
        Viktor: The Additional section is OK
                DoT resolver often makes unauthenticated requests and creates false sense of security

464XLAT/NAT64 Optimization, draft-ietf-v6ops-464xlat-optimization
        Jordi Palet Martinez
        Work in V6OPS WG that relates to DNSOP
        Please have the discussion in V6OPS, not in DNSOP
