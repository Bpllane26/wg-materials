### Day 1 ###

Administrivia

Hackathon Report
Benno Overeinder
	Overview of the many projects from this Hackathon

Message Digest for DNS Zones
draft-ietf-dnsop-dns-zone-digest
Duane Wessels
	(No slides)
	Added multiple digests per zone
	Two interoperable implementations
	Ready for WG Last Call? Proposed standard or experimental?
	Suzanne: Are people comfortable with deploying at scale, even with the experimental stuff in Section 5
	John Levine: Doesn't understand what is hard to deploy with this
		Duane: Large dynamic zones
		John: Comfortable with static, and people will experiment later
	Alex Mayrhofer: Which are the implementations?
		Duane: LDNS in C, and Shane Kerr in Python
		Alex: Experimental
	Warren Kumari: If it experimental, we have to say what the experiment is
		Suzanne: That leans towards standards
		Benno: NLNetLabs plans to implement in next year

Extended DNS Errors
draft-ietf-dnsop-extended-error
Wes Hardaker
	People seem to really care!
	Better than not caring
	Discussion of EDE overflow options
		Set TC bit, don't set TC bit, create new bit
		Ray Bellis: A minimal error response only needs the Question section
			Wes: Could still live in the wild
		Mike StJohns: Need to say for UDP-specific
			Likes create new bit
		Ondrej Sury: Don't do anything special
			Set TC bit
		Ralf Weber:
			Set TC bit
		Eric Orth:
			Create a new bit
			Doesn't want to do another round trip
		Petr Špaček: Don't set TC bit
		Robert Story: Keep EDE but throw away glue records
		Brian Dickson: Use TC bit and create new bit
		Mike StJohns: Definition of TC bit says you will get the same thing back
			Wes: No, it's a hint
		Ondrej: You could hit a different server if you come back over TCP
	Forwarding case
		Brian: Locally-generated generated identity from ABCD group
			Wants 4.1
		Ray: Don't do anything
		RalfW: Multiple boxes in the stream won't have been updated
		Ben Schwartz: Doesn't like the idea
			Efficiency issue
			There is no signal in the query, so you have to do this all the time
			Forward it, or set your own answer
		Ondrej: Forwarding is not specified in this document, might be added when there is more experience
			Wes: That's what we have now
				The list wanted resolvers to pass to end uers
		Vittorio Bertola: Without tracing, will be useful
		Ray: EDNS doesn't work this way, it is really hop-by-hop
		Brian: Forwarders that don't know EDE don't add any value
			Finding the resolver's name is the big value
	More on the list about both

Service binding and parameter specification via the DNS (DNS SVCB and HTTPSSVC)
draft-ietf-dnsop-svcb-httpssvc
Ben Schwartz
	Mark Andrews: Keep the zero
	Ray: Using a SHOULD may make getting early allocation for code point
	Eric: Wants shorter chain legths
		Come up with a better name
	Alex: Could the names be for the authoritative name server
	Mark: SHOULD is fine, if it isn't MUST
	(?) from Cloudflare: Is the alias form required?
		Ben: No
			Examples are the most complicated possible
			Will add simpler examples
	(?) from Jabber: Concerned about when no clients need ANAME record
	Brian: Updates DNAME and CNAME
	(?): ESNI has its own format
		Helps make server that only does HTTP3 clearer
	RalfW: With caching, the stub is rarely affected
		Hints section text is now superflouous?
		Ben: Requested from ESNI folks
			Prevents the stub from doing chain-walking for address records
		In 11.1, could not find key0 and key5
	Tommy Pauly: Needs to work well with resolvers that don't know about it
		What is the timeframe for the bikeshed?
	Ralf Dolmans: How does alias chain spread out?
		Ben: If resolver see an alias record, need to send out three queries
	Ondrej: Likes the idea of IP hint
	Dan York: Are there client implementers for this?
		Eric: Yes
	Mark: Wire formats need to be stable for early allocation
	David Schinazi: Yes, we want this
	Brian: Implementing at least the 0 case, maybe others

### Day 2 ###

DNS Transport over TCP - Operational Requirements
draft-ietf-dnsop-dns-tcp-requirements
Duane Wessels
	Latest draft -05
		Mentions TLS
		Dropped TFO to MAY
		Other updates
	Ready for WG LC?
	Ondrej: Will use this document as a base for BIND updates
	Brian: Will look over it for GoDaddy suthoritative implementation
	Petr: We have feedback next year

Interoperable Domain Name System (DNS) Server Cookies
draft-ietf-dnsop-server-cookies
Willem Toorop
	PaulW: What privacy is gained?
		Willem: Don't send out the address when the address changes
	Wes: Agrees with PaulW, but why can't the client just change its secret all the time?
		Willem: The server would send the same cookie
		Wes: Client can decide how long its cookies live
		Willem: Client should notice if the server doesn't support cookies
	Jim: How often is often?
		Willem: If your client IP does not change, you don't need to change it
		Jim: Give guidance about "often"
		Ondrej: Draft says one year
	PaulH: Maybe bring this to the list
	Suzanne: Next step is coding

Related Domains By DNS
draft-brotman-rdbd
Stephen Farrell
	Warren: Do you need both sides to point to each other for "related"?
		Stephen: Yes
	Warren: Likes the "unrelated" case
	Petr: Looking for practical use cases, not theoretical
		Stephen: Comcast has some
	Daniel Migault: Impact on size of responses?
		Stephen: Pretty small
	John L: Not convinced about DNSSEC-like
		Also: without the Mozilla PSL, this isn't useful
		Would want to do the DBOUND problem
		Stephen: Is there a small part of the problem that can be used?
	Tim: Salesforce has a real use case
		This is step 1
		Would like to see something like this start to happen
	John L: Useful to say "two subtrees are the same"
	Benno: Will take to mailing list
	PaulH: Define "this"
	Stephen: Maybe ask the list about each doc

Operational recommendations for management of DNSSEC Validator
draft-mglt-dnsop-dnssec-validator-requirements
Daniel Migault
	Leif Johanson: Is it meaniful to expose this to the outside world? "Here is how I establish trust?"
		Making trust auditable?
		Daniel: Haven't thought about it
		Leif: It's turtles all the way down
		Daniel: Underspecified in the current version
	Chris Box: Thank you for the document
		Really useful
		Daniel: Had issues for positioning correctly
	Yoshiro Yoneya: Supports document
		Impetus of MTA operation is to have more contact the customer support center
		Add this to the draft
		Daniel: Is in NTA document
	Lots of people now interested in reading the document

Avoid IP fragmentation in DNS
draft-fujiwara-dnsop-avoid-fragmentation
Kazunori Fujiwara
	Ondrej: There is a draft in the Int Area saying that fragmentation is fragil
		All this is UDP-specific
		Let that draft finish first, then do DNS-specific things
	Warren: It is in RFC Editor queue
	John L: There is DNS-specific stuff that we can say
		Should adopt
	Brian: Might need embellishments, split out resolver-to-auth and stub-to-recursive
		Give the recommendations up front
	Geoff Huston: This is too prescriptive
		Jumping to solutions based on edge case
		Timeouts are most important
		Probably the wrong approach
		Davey Song's ATR
		For UDP, run with high MTUs because TCP is the last resort
		This is solving the 6-12% problem by making it a problem on everyone
		There is no hurry
		Not ready for adoption
	Brian: Vulnerability to cache poisoning due to fragmentation
	Suzanne: Shows a lot of effort, but we should wait and see the status on the Int Area work
		Then see what of this work is DNS-specific and useful
	Mark: Cookies are not perfect

User Assigned ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 Codes and the DNS Root Zone
draft-arends-private-use-tld
Roy Arends
	Brian: Great, has a use case for it
		Prefer delegated unsiged
	Warren: Lots of thoughts
		Agree that we need an interal namespace
		Took it to ICANN
		Roy: Wants it to be private space
			Doesn't want it to semantic
		Wants it to be semantic
		Needs to be an insecure delegation
		Wants it to go somewhere
		Read Suzanne's expired document
	Suzanne: IETF cannot decide what goes into the root zone
	Stewart Cheshire: Inspired idea, wish we had thought of it 15 years ago
		Discuss with ICANN to be sure there will not be conflict
		Teminology suggestion: don't use "private", but instead "internal"
		Different people have different views of who gets to choose the name
		Industry can pick within the industry
	Jim: Could become a rathole quickly
		Simpler is to list the codes, say "pick one"
	Terry Manderson: Loves this
		Avoids a lot of political skirmishes
	Wes: Do both signed and unsigned
		Roy: this could be the undelegated, .internal could be delegated
	Petr: Collisions will happen when organizations merge
		Terrible things will happen the longer it goes on
		Roy: Merging firms will have lots of problems
	Klensin: No representative of history
		TC 46 can do different things
		Roy: Looks for engagement on WG list
	(?) Gupta: Enterprise users don't read / don't care
		Who would anyone use this?
		Roy: There has never been a BCP, so we can point to it
	Stewart: As things evolve in the DNS
		The incentive increases for identifying internal names

Chairs: Please read draft-pusateri-dnsop-update-timeout because we ran out of time
