## 2021-09-17

* avoid-fragmentation
- Q - can this doc be a BCP if it’s a range of values?
    + (Chairs believe so; the ‘best current practice’ being recommended is to tune this parameter as potentially important, not accept system defaults w/out looking)
- Single value or range of values?
    + Appropriate value(s)? (Different values may be appropriate for different conditions; how much detail to include?)
    + Editorial changes for readability?
- preferred value needs to be justified, not just stated

    - Is sibling glue optional or required? (MUST or SHOULD)
    - Examples of valid sibling glue
    - Also bad/invalid examples
    - Clarification on truncated glue

* Ben: Two questions: what is the glue policy, and what happens when the glue doesn't fit

    - Permit a range of behaviors
