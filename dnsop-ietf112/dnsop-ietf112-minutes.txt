DNSOP WG at IETF 112
November 11 and 12, 2021
On Meetecho, not in Madrid
Agenda is at https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/112/materials/agenda-112-dnsop
Minutes here only reflect the mic line, not text on the slides

Chairs discussion

Guidance for NSEC3 parameter settings, Wes Hardaker
	draft-ietf-dnsop-nsec3-guidance
	Ted Lemon: Questions choice of insecure for validating stub resolver
		Stub resolver might want to treat >100 as an attack
		Wes: Gut reaction is that splitting types will lead to chaos
			Precedent is to act like NSEC3 works today
	Viktor Dukhovni: When we treat high counts as insecure, every answer under that must be treated as insecure
		Gap between insecure and SERVFAIL: SERVFAIL allows the zone to be treated as secure
	Jim Reid: Agrees with Ted, would prefer to respond with SERVFAIL instead of insecure at 0 or 1
	Ralf Weber: Middleground can cause problems, just have one signal
		Wants a hard cut
	Wes: Maybe have draft allow sliding toward goal
	Petr Špaček: Be strict for zone owners, but allow sliding for validators
		Just describe for validators why there are thresholds, but don't give values
		Describe the properties
	Benno Overeinder (as implementer): Agrees with Petr
		Thanks Viktor for doing the measurements

DNSSEC automation, Ulrich Wisser
	draft-wisser-dnssec-automation
	Shumon Huque: Working on the draft has helped get providers to implement the key operations part
		Will get more progress if this is a WG document
	Paul Hoffman: Does this need to be in DNSOP, or maybe a different WG that is more operator-specific
	Peter Thomassen: If the receiving operator uses a different algorithm, there could be protocol implications
	Ralf: Thinks this belongs in DNSOP
	Viktor: Implementers of nameservers might need to make changes to software, so leave it here
	Ulrich: Requires complicated state machine in the nameserver to make this work
		Will have implementation in coming months, testing before IETF 113

Survey of Domain Verification Techniques using DNS, Shivan Kaul
	draft-sahib-domain-verification-techniques
	Paul Wouters: This is very important, already a huge problem
	Shumon: Current use is quite ad hoc, big security gap
	Joey Salazar: Other than a security analysis, what are the next steps?
		What has changed since last meeting to support adoption more?
		Shivan: Collecting issues
			Will add section comparing TXT vs. CNAME
	Benno: Discussed how this can fit in with other documents in the queue
	Tim Wicinski: Don't stop working on this, it's important
		Shumon: Will keep plugging, but want more collaborators
	Brett Carr: Supports; suggests that the title be changed to not just be about survey
		Shivan: Will be more about guidance instead of prescriptive
	PeterT: Wonders who the target for the draft is
		Wants to be sure the major users are involved in preparing the draft
	Shumon: Will do outreach to the communities that are already doing this
		Ask what would persuade them to adopt this
	PaulW and Brett volunteered to help

Structured Data for DNS Access Denied Error Page, Dan Wing
	draft-wing-dnsop-structured-dns-error-page
	Ben Schwartz: Very cautious about anything that lets the DNS operator to jump into a web conversation
		There are no safe use case in the web context
		Would like a shift to technical use cases and debugging
		Could also be used for other DNS failures; an addendum for extended error code
		Should not be shown to the user to lie or scare them
	Jonathan Reed: Sees a use case for debugging and enterprises
		Wants an indicator with an NXDOMAIN
		Can be in the middle ground between blocking and full access
		Could be a signal that "it's not just you"
	Andrew Campling: Bad censors work just fine, this helps good censors
		Gives visibility to the good cases
		Current UI is crap, this gives a better end-user experience in enterprises
	Eric Orth: It should be scary 
		Agrees with Ben
		Usable for debugging, like EDE, but wants more info on 
	PaulH: Is scared by the idea that this is for enterprise only (from earlier speakers)
		Dan: Saying what is and isn't enterprise is impossible
			Is meant for the whole Internet
	Brian Dickson: Thinking about RPZ changing response codes
		Could add provenience in these responses based on trust of the source
		Dan: Didn't go that way because of requirements for DNSSEC
		
Various drafts, Brian Dickson
	draft-dickson-dnsop-ds-hack, draft-dickson-dnsop-glueless, draft-dickson-dprive-adot-auth, draft-dickson-dprive-dnst
	Ben: Thinking along the same lines, good that we have lots of interest
		We are not ready to jump in on any of these
		SVCB-DNS is adopted in ADD WG, similar to DST, would prefer not to have multiple methods
			Brian: was using none of the value proposition, did DST as a shortcut
				Agrees we should not have two ways, wants more expedient
		Glueless delegations have a lot of security properties
			Assumes that this set of queries are non-sensitive
			Wants more discussion on this
	Viktor: What does NSV bring to the table?
		Wants more discussion about value in cases where there is already encryption
		Brian: Doesn't assume that data encryption gives data integrity
		Why new TLSA type?
		Brian: Motivation to remove the prefixes is for better signaling
	Daniel Kahn Gillmor: Have you attempted to deploy the NSV algorithm to active zones?
		Brian: Tried a few, but couldn't get past the UI
			Easier to get deployment if they have an early allocation
			Doesn't expect pushback from registry operators
		Viktor: Some registries reject new types
		
[[ Beginning of second meeting ]]

DNS Catalog Zones, Willem Toorop
	draft-ietf-dnsop-dns-catalog-zones
	Wes: Some names will leak; what are you thinking of naming for the left side?
		Would like examples under .arpa, don't use a real TLD
		Willem: Agrees
	PeterT: How about suggesting only using only names they own?
		Willem: Or a reserved TLD
	PaulW: Was initially skeptical, is now really happy with it
		Likes the multi-vendor part
		Kudos, keep going
	Viktor: Questions the security of the transport
		Willem: It's in the draft
		Could these zones be signed? Is this crazy?
			Willem: Interesting to consider
	Benno: Getting close to WG Last Call
		Already implemented, getting feedback from users
		Willem: Interop testing still going on

IETF Hackathon DNS Results, Willem Toorop
	Tom Carpay presented on EDER results  (see slides)
	Peter van Dijk: Asked if there was a bug in the spec or in the testing
		Tom: In the testing
	Ben: Why are you sending an unsolicited extension
		Willem: Was discussed at last iterim
			Wanting to determine if this is OK
		Questions whether 0.1% is too high
			Willem: This might be due to the normal DNS error rate
		Will like to see more testing

Guidance for NSEC3 parameter settings (nsec3.2), Wes Hardaker
	draft-ietf-dnsop-nsec3-guidance  (new set of slides)
	PaulW: Don't normally expiry dates
		Don't think this should be in the document
		Should appear in the normally-updated document
		Wes: This is history, not future
			"As of this publication"
	Petr: Maybe make a history appendix
		This is not setting any expire date, doesn't see the objection
	Viktor: Maybe just recommend 100 as the upper bound for the upper bound
		Wordsmithing
	Peter Koch: Are we talking about operators or vendors?
		Wes: Will clarify difference
	Petr: As a vendor, needs reasonable guidance for defaults
	Suzanne: Much more on the mailing list
		Send text
	Viktor: PeterK if he has any problems reducing to 0
	PeterK: Has a concern of the approach of driving this through by a standard
		Slippery slope that this is a compliance game
		Wes: It is a security issue

Automatic DNSSEC Bootstrapping using Authenticated Signals from the Zone's Operator, Peter Thomassen
	draft-thomassen-dnsop-dnssec-bootstrapping
	Glad people chimed in on the hashing discussion
	Viktor: Let's adopt, without hashing
	PaulW: Likes the majority of the work
	Benno: Are adopting new work, but in a controlled way
		Are on the short list

Suzanne: Will likely have interims between IETF meetings
