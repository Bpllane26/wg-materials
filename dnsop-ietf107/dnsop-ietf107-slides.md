# Reference

### BlueSheets

Attendees are asked to visit and enter your Name+Affiliation in the Blue-Sheet
section of the DNSOP Etherpad.

### Mic Line Queue

The Mic Line will use the WebEx chat channel.  To get in the queue type q+ to leave type q-.
Please don't type questions or other things into the WebEx chat channel as that will make
managing the queue very hard for the chairs.  Please use the Jabber channel for side conversations.

When you connect into WebEx you should start off as auto-muted so you'll
need to unmute yourself to speak when called.

### Helpful Info & Prep

The IETF has prepared a couple of documents to help get everyone ready.
