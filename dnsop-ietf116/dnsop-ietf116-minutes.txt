Only stuff said that happened at the mic is reported here

Administrivia and updates of old work

GNU Name System (Very Short Update), Christian Grothoff
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-schanzen-gns/
	Warren Kumari: Need to reply to authors
		Did the IETF conflict review
			Close to DNSOP, but doesn't prevent publication
			Has a limited number of possible responses in the conflict review
	Wes Hardaker: Thank you for using .alt
		Lots of cool technology in the protocol
		Christian: Knew that they had publish a RFC
		Conflict with the RRtypes, prevents working with the DNS in the future
	George Michaelson: Mostly philosophical comments
		Implement a registry function for .alt
		First occupant has some expectation of structure
		Who has control of the registry?
			Christian: Will do first come, first served in their own .alt
		Has an issue with "reservers"
		Should not be spinning an alternate registry
			Christian: Didn't get an IANA, so they did their own
	Eliot Lear: Thanks to the WG, authors and ADs
		Has not made a publication decision yet
		Invites people to still commment to the ISE

Structured Error Data for Filtered DNS - Document Update, Tirumal Reddy
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-structured-dns-error/
	Ben Schwartz: Would like to see the registries tightly controlled: IETF review
		Wants to prevent the designated expert from being pressured for odd states
	Tommy Pauly: Agrees with Ben on reviews
		Wants the text to not be browser-specific
		Contact info marked as mandatory
			There may be future cases which don't need contact info
			Browser or OS may know better than the DNS about what to do because it has more context
			Tiru: Agrees, didn't put specific URIs in
			Should be a list of URIs, but may be too narrow
	
Structured Error Data for Filtered DNS - Implementation, Gianpaolo Scalone (remote) and Ralf Weber (local)
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-structured-dns-error/
	Designed an extension for Chrome
	Wes: Super happy to see the deployment
		Ralf: No address redirection
			Use NXDOMAIN with EDE
		What is the UI when the main page is fine but are requesting sub-resource like JS or CSS
	Tiru: Don't want a user to go to another page, so put it all on the main page
	Gianpaolo: Sees some text to explain this
	Tiru: Can address comments gotten here

Domain Verification Techniques using DNS, Shivan Kaul Sahib
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-domain-verification-techniques
	Yasuhiro Morishita: Wants information for external DNS providers
		Users cannot usually add underscore names
	John Levine: Draft has considerbly improved
		Wants more definition of what is machine-readable and what is human-readable
		Give plausible argument about why CNAME is not a good idea
	Wes: Encourage text that says if not using DNSSEC, must do other mechanisms

Compact Denial of Existence in DNSSEC, Shumon Huque
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-huque-dnsop-compact-lies/
	Lars-Johan Liman: Does the draft do things differently if the DO bit is set?
		Shumon: Not currently, but is considering
		But this has impact on resolver, please describe in document
	Viktor Dukhovni: A lot of complexity depending on resolver setting DO bit
		Someone might deliberately send known NXDOMAIN through resolvers
			Shumon: Will document this
		May take a while for current implementations to go away
			Shumon: Optimistic that the current implementers can change quickly
	Jim Reid: Skeptical of this
		Rather ugly from protocol point of view
		A lot of work for just to make responses shorter
		Would want it to be informational
			Shumon: Wants to implement what is already done
	Christian Elmerot: Thinks that this simplifies things quite a bit
		Already using in production, but are doing it differently
		Wants to have one way to suggested
		Jim: Happy to have this help coordination, not standard
	Ralf: Thanks for doing this, need to document it
		Should minimize impact on the rest of the ecosystem

Consistency for CDS/CDNSKEY and CSYNC is Mandatory, Peter Thomassen (remote)
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-thomassen-dnsop-cds-consistency/
	Viktor: Corner case: if someone is moving to a hoster that doesn't do DNSSEC
		Peter: Could add a way to turn off DNSSEC on transfer
	Johan Stenstram: Breaks the logic that "if it is signed, it is good"
		Doesn't like "if this is really important"
		Let's not go there
		Authoritative servers are proxies for the registrant
		Out of sync is reflection on the registrant: business issues
	Wes: CSYNC was for keeping DNS up and running
		CSYNC can't fix the business problems
	Peter: Agrees that one signature should be OK
		Other parts of the spec also suggest asking multiple places

Generalized DNS Notifications, Johan Stenstam
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-thomassen-dnsop-generalized-dns-notify/
	Viktor: Once it is a service, is the transport UDP?

DNS Out Of Protocol Signalling, Willem Toorop
	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-grubto-dnsop-dns-out-of-protocol-signalling/
	Lars-Johan: Please do this
