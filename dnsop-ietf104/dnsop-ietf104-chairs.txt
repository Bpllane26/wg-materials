## Various issues raised in the DoH context
Karlin 1/2, Wednesday 15:00 CEST

There have been some interest and discussion about the deployment of DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS, RFC 8484) and some of its possible consequences. While it appeared in the DoH context, it may be broader. 

The discussions currently take place on WG doh and dprive but could also be of interest for dnsop and HRPC
