# KSK Futures BoF
Thursday, 0900-1030, Congress Hall 2

IANA is collecting community input so it can decide what to do in the future with the DNS root KSK

BoF will be a short introduction followed by lots of mic time

Similar meeting happened at ICANN 64 in Kobe, and another will happen at the ICANN DNS Symposium in May

There is also a mailing list which allows longer discussion threads: https://mm.icann.org/mailman/listinfo/ksk-rollover
